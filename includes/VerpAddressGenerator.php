	 * them less information to work from.
	 * This makes brute force attacks easier. An attacker would be able to brute force the signature
	 * by sending an average of 2^95 emails to us. We would (hopefully) notice that.
	 * This would make finding a collision slightly easier if the secret key was known,
	 * but the constraints on each segment (wiki id must be valid, timestamp needs to be within a
	 * certain limit), combined with the difficulty of finding collisions when the key is unknown,
	 * makes this virtually impossible.
